(Pasted from an LLM chat.  Need to add to and tune this.)

If your Slack Workspace allows you to create “Slack Apps”:

Step 1 – Create a Slack App for Yourself

Go to https://api.slack.com/apps

Click “Create New App” → From Scratch

Give it a name (e.g., channel-exporter) and choose your workspace

Under OAuth & Permissions, scroll to Scopes

Add these user scopes:
```
channels:history
groups:history
im:history
mpim:history
users:read
channels:read
groups:read
im:read
mpim:read
```


Click Install App to Workspace → Allow

Copy your User OAuth Token — it will look like:

`xoxp-1234567890-0987654321-ABCDEF...`

Step 2 – Use That Token in a Local Export Script

Example using Python + Slack SDK:
```
from slack_sdk import WebClient
import json

token = "xoxp-your-user-token"
client = WebClient(token=token)
channel_name = "atak-chat"

# Get channel list
channels = client.conversations_list(types="public_channel,private_channel")["channels"]
channel_id = next(c["id"] for c in channels if c["name"] == channel_name)

# Pull all messages
messages = []
cursor = None
while True:
    resp = client.conversations_history(channel=channel_id, cursor=cursor, limit=200)
    messages.extend(resp["messages"])
    cursor = resp.get("response_metadata", {}).get("next_cursor")
    if not cursor:
        break

# Save raw export
with open(f"{channel_name}.json", "w") as f:
    json.dump(messages, f, indent=2)
print(f"Saved {len(messages)} messages from #{channel_name}")
```

Then you can run a cleanup/anonymization pass like the one I showed earlier.

⚠️ Note:

This only pulls messages from channels you’re a member of.

If your workspace blocks custom apps, this method won’t work (you’ll get a “not_allowed_token_type” error).
